# RectiTrack

## Overview
RectiTrack is an application allowing users to create, view, update, and delete rectangles stored in a database. Each rectangle is uniquely identified for efficient management. The system ensures seamless interactions, robust data validation, and comprehensive error handling for reliability.

## Features
- **Add New Rectangles:** Users should be able to add new rectangles with their attributes.
- **Delete Rectangles:** Users should be able to delete any rectangle.
- **Display Rectangles:** The app should display all rectangles currently in the database on a main page. This page does not need to show all attributes
- **Edit Rectangle Attributes:** The detailed display page should allow users to edit certain rectangle attributes. For instance, clicking on an attribute value could allow the user to alter it.
